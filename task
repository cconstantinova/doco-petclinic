Create a docker-compose file with the following containers: 
alpine, mysql, jenkins, petclinic
 
mysql should store all information inside of the volume, so after recreation data should persist 

communication between mysql, jenkins, petclinic should be non-accessible from outside 

on alpine (using dockerfile) should be installed nginx and reverse-proxy to jenkins to be accessible 
petclinic should connect to mysql and be accessible through nginx from alpine container
